Our study evaluates the BLIP model's performance in Visual Question Answering (VQA) across three datasets. Using WUPS Score, BERT Score, VQA Score, etc, we assess its ability to generalise and predict answers accurately. We provide insights into metric selection, rationale, and advantages/disadvantages. This analysis informs on the BLIP model's capabilities in VQA, guiding future research.
