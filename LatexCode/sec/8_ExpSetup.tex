\section{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:formatting}
Since the VQA v2.0  dataset was very large (approximately 82,000 in the training dataset), we divided it into 10 parts and split these parts among the 3 members to achieve parallelisation. We used the BLIP model for each part and then combined the outputs for all the parts to evaluate the results.
For the validation set of VQA v2 we divided it into 2 parts and combined the outputs for both parts to evaluate the results.
DAQUAR dataset was not large (approximately 1500 images), so we did not divide it into parts.
